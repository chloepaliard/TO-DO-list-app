# TO-DO-list-app
School project which consisted in creating an app that enabled users to create and store TO-DO lists, with numerous options. We created that app entirely in a limited amount of time and it was required to only use native Android. This app was conceived in a user centered view, with a lot of pre-work consisiting in polls and interviews.
