# TO-DO-list-app

This app is a school project that I made with 3 friends. The project consisted in coding an app that enabled users to create and store TO-DO lists, with numerous options. We created that app entirely, in a limited amount of time. It was required to only use native Android. This app was conceived in a user centered view, with a lot of pre-work consisiting in polls and interviews.

You need an Android phone to run it.

Some functionnalities were not implemented due to a lack of time, like the calendar or the alarm system.
